### I'm on PICOvation duty

Hi! This minigame is a demake of the game "I'm on observation duty". Here you will need to watch the cameras for several locations and check that no anomalies have occurred. Can you survive from midnight to 6 AM?

WARNING: Game contains load disgusting sounds.

**Controls:**
- Left and right arrows - switch cameras
- Z - open anomaly report menu
- X - close anomaly report menu

When the anomaly report menu is open:
- Left and right arrows - switch menu pages
- Up and down arrows - switch menu options
- Z - send a report

**How to send a report:**
If you notice an anomaly, open the anomaly report menu on the camera, where it occurred, use the arrows to select the desired anomaly from the eight types offered, and send the report by pressing the Z key.

In total, there are 3 cameras and more than 60 anomalies

**Hints:**
- One game minute is added every second of real time
- Some anomalies occur with sound
- If you miss 4 or more anomalies, you will lose
- Every mistake can lead to an anomaly
- Some anomalies can be very sneaky, so this is a test of your attentiveness!
